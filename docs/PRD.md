# Ritual PRD

## Summary

Ritual is a zero-friction interactive CLI that turns repeated coding-agent prompts into reusable skills.

The product wedge is:

> Your coding-agent history already contains the workflows you repeat. This CLI finds them, ranks them, and turns the best ones into reusable skills.

Ritual is not a full-featured history viewer. The primary history scan exists to discover repeated workflows that are good candidates for skills. The MVP succeeds when a user creates one high-quality reusable `SKILL.md` from repeated Claude or Codex prompts.

## Problem

Developers repeatedly ask coding agents to perform similar tasks: refactors, reviews, documentation updates, test generation, release preparation, bug triage, and repo-specific workflows. Those workflows are usually scattered across local agent history and rarely get promoted into reusable instructions.

Existing history tools help users inspect what happened. Existing skill generators help package a workflow once the user already knows what to encode. Ritual connects those categories by finding repeated workflows inside real agent history and turning the best candidate into a reusable skill.

## Target Users

- Developers who use Claude Code, Codex, or both for recurring coding tasks.
- Maintainers who want repo-specific or personal agent skills without manually mining old sessions.
- Power users who want to standardize successful prompts and workflows across projects.

## Product Principles

- The default interface is `bunx ritualai@latest`.
- Lightweight inspection can use `bunx ritualai@latest prompts` or `bunx ritualai@latest --prompts`.
- The default skill-generation flow must not require flags.
- All decisions happen through interactive prompts.
- The primary artifact is one high-quality `SKILL.md`.
- The user must approve before any skill is written.
- History data stays local by default.
- Agent discovery uses a user-selected local executable and returns findings to the same CLI session.
- Local clustering remains available as a fallback candidate source.

## Goals

- Scan local Claude and Codex history sources.
- Extract user prompts only.
- Let a user-selected local agent inspect discovered session/history paths for skill candidates.
- Parse structured agent findings back into the CLI.
- Fall back to local clustering and ranking by recurrence, coherence, and likely usefulness.
- Present top candidates interactively.
- Let the user approve, rename, or reject candidates.
- Let users dump the latest extracted prompts in terminal date order for inspection.
- Generate one skill per run.
- Use an embedded, versioned skill-generation prompt derived from `skill-creator`.
- Call a local coding-agent executable, such as `claude` or `codex`, only after user approval.
- Let the selected agent write the approved skill directly to the first target path.
- Validate generated skill drafts with built-in `SKILL.md` checks and, when available, `agnix`.
- Write the same approved `SKILL.md` to Claude, Codex/agents, or both selected targets.

## Non-Goals

- Fully automatic skill generation without review.
- A full-featured agent history browser.
- Batch skill generation.
- Subcommand-driven skill-generation workflows.
- CLI flags for the default skill-generation flow.
- Cloud sync, hosted accounts, or shared team skill registries.
- Uploading history for semantic clustering.
- Deep semantic indexing across complete assistant responses.
- Guaranteeing that generated skills are correct without user review.

## MVP User Flow

1. The user runs `bunx ritualai@latest`.
2. Ritual discovers local Claude and Codex history files.
3. Ritual reports source-level diagnostics, including how many prompts were extracted from each source.
4. Ritual extracts only user-authored prompts.
5. Ritual asks whether a local agent should inspect the discovered session/history paths for skill candidates.
6. The selected local agent opens in the terminal and reads those paths.
7. The agent presents a Markdown candidate table, gives an opinionated recommendation, and asks which skill or skills the user wants to implement.
8. The agent continues implementation in the same window after the user answers.
9. If agent discovery is declined, unavailable, or exits unsuccessfully, Ritual falls back to local normalization, clustering, and ranking.

## Functional Requirements

### Invocation

- The MVP command is `bunx ritualai@latest`.
- The default flow must not require users to learn subcommands.
- The default flow must not require users to remember flags.
- `bunx ritualai@latest prompts` and `bunx ritualai@latest --prompts` dump the latest extracted prompts to stdout.
- `bunx ritualai@latest prompts --limit N` changes the dump count.
- Runtime choices must be made through interactive prompts.
- Internal implementation may still use modules for scan, cluster, draft, validate, and write.

### History Discovery

- Detect supported Claude history locations.
- Detect supported Codex history locations.
- Ask interactively for additional history paths when automatic discovery is incomplete.
- Report which sources were scanned.
- Report prompt extraction counts per source.
- Allow partial support with clear diagnostics when one source cannot be parsed.
- Do not require network access for history scanning.

### Prompt Extraction

- Extract user prompts only.
- Exclude assistant responses, tool outputs, system messages, and metadata unless needed for parsing.
- Preserve enough source metadata to show where each prompt came from.
- Handle malformed or partially written history records without crashing.
- Continue scanning other sources if one source fails.

### Prompt Normalization

- Normalize superficial differences such as whitespace and casing where useful.
- Preserve the original prompt text for review.
- Avoid stripping details that distinguish different workflows.
- Keep enough representative prompt text to support high-quality skill generation.

### Clustering

- Use local-only clustering as the fallback candidate source.
- Group similar user prompts into workflow candidates when fallback ranking runs.
- Support repeated prompts that are semantically similar but not identical.
- Default strong-candidate threshold to 3 similar prompts.
- Let the user interactively lower the threshold to 2 when results are sparse.
- Keep representative examples for each cluster.

### Ranking

- Rank fallback candidates by repeat count.
- Rank fallback candidates by cluster coherence.
- Prefer candidates with enough prompt detail to produce a useful skill.
- De-prioritize one-off, vague, or low-signal prompts.
- Show the reason each candidate ranked highly.
- If no candidate meets the strong threshold, show near-misses and do not generate by default.

### Agent Discovery

- Let the user choose whether a local agent should inspect discovered session/history paths.
- Pass session/history paths to the selected local agent rather than a preselected prompt cluster.
- Tell the discovery agent to inspect existing project/global Claude and Codex/agents skill directories before returning findings.
- Suppress workflows already covered by existing skills, and keep partially covered workflows only when the missing behavior is substantial.
- Require the discovery agent to present a Markdown candidate table in its own window.
- Require findings to include suggested name, summary, rationale, confidence, suggested scope, representative generalized prompts, and source paths.
- Require an opinionated recommendation before asking which skill or skills the user wants to implement.
- Let the agent ask the user which skill or skills to implement and continue in the same window.
- Before writing any selected skill, require the agent to ask whether to install project-local to the current command path or global under the user's home directory, showing concrete target paths for both choices.
- Do not let the discovery agent write files before the user approves an implementation choice.
- Fall back to local clustering and ranking when agent discovery is declined, unavailable, or exits unsuccessfully.

### Interactive Review

- Display top repeated workflow candidates in the terminal.
- Show candidate name, count or confidence, summary, rationale, and representative prompts or examples.
- Let the user approve one candidate.
- Let the user reject candidates.
- Let the user rename the approved candidate.
- Generate at most one skill per run.

### Scope Selection

- Recommend project-local or global scope based on the selected candidate.
- Mark candidates as likely project-specific when prompts mention repo files, local commands, framework choices, CI, package managers, or project names.
- Mark candidates as likely global when prompts are tool- or task-generic.
- Require user confirmation of scope.
- Default to project-local scope when run inside a repository.
- Resolve project-local paths relative to the current directory where `bunx ritualai@latest` was run.

### Output Ecosystem Selection

- Let the user select Claude, Codex/agents, or both.
- Write the same generated `SKILL.md` to every selected target.
- Do not generate ecosystem-specific variants in the MVP.
- Do not create ecosystem-specific metadata files in the MVP.

Target paths:

- Project-local Claude: `./.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Project-local Codex/agents: `./.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Global Claude: the user's global Claude skills directory
- Global Codex/agents: the user's global agents skills directory

When run inside a repository, the recommended default is project-local scope and both ecosystems.

### Skill Drafting

- Use an embedded, versioned skill-generation prompt derived from `skill-creator`.
- Do not load the user's installed `skill-creator` at runtime for default behavior.
- Include the approved candidate name, representative prompts, rank rationale, selected scope, and selected ecosystem targets in the drafting prompt.
- Call a local agent executable to draft the skill only after user approval.
- Support `claude` when available.
- Support `codex` when available.
- Launch the selected agent as an inherited terminal session with the generated drafting prompt as the final argument.
- Make the agent invocation explicit before running it because local agent tools may call external services depending on user configuration.
- Do not improvise the skill-generation prompt per candidate.

The generated skill must be high quality. It should use the shared `SKILL.md` format:

- A lowercase hyphen-case skill name.
- YAML frontmatter with only `name` and `description`.
- A trigger-rich `description` that explains when the skill should be used.
- A concise Markdown body written as actionable instructions.
- Imperative or infinitive instruction style.
- No `README.md`, changelog, installation guide, or unrelated auxiliary docs.
- Optional `scripts/`, `references/`, or `assets/` only when the repeated workflow clearly needs them.

### Validation

- Validate that the selected skill target contains a `SKILL.md`.
- Validate YAML frontmatter format.
- Validate that frontmatter contains only `name` and `description`.
- Validate that `name` is lowercase hyphen-case.
- Validate that `description` includes clear trigger contexts.
- Validate that the body is not empty.
- Validate that the body is not placeholder text.
- Use `agnix` validation when available.
- Fall back to built-in checks when `agnix` is unavailable.
- Report blocking validation errors.

Blocking errors:

- Missing `SKILL.md`.
- Invalid YAML frontmatter.
- Frontmatter fields other than `name` and `description`.
- Invalid skill name.
- Missing or weak trigger description.
- Empty or mostly placeholder body.

Warnings:

- Body is too generic.
- Body repeats obvious model capabilities.
- Body lacks concrete workflow steps.
- Body exceeds a configured length threshold.
- Body mentions bundled resources but no files are present.

### Skill Output

- Create parent directories when needed.
- Avoid overwriting an existing skill unless the user confirms interactively.
- Sanitize skill names for filesystem-safe paths.
- Write the same final `SKILL.md` to all selected targets.
- Print the final path or paths after writing.

## Data Handling Requirements

- Treat local history as sensitive developer data.
- Do not upload history by default.
- Extract and process history locally.
- Keep scan and fallback cluster results ephemeral by default.
- Do not persist agent discovery findings.
- Make agent invocation explicit because discovery and drafting may use external model services through the user's local agent configuration.

## Success Metrics

- The user can create one valid reusable skill from repeated history in one interactive session.
- The presented candidates contain workflows the user recognizes as repeated or worth reusing.
- The user can reject noise without editing files manually.
- A generated skill passes structural validation.
- The output path matches the selected scope and ecosystem targets.
- The CLI can be used successfully with only `bunx ritualai@latest`.

## MVP Acceptance Criteria

- Given local Claude and Codex history sources, Ritual extracts user prompts without assistant content.
- Given one unsupported or malformed source, Ritual reports diagnostics and continues with any supported sources.
- Given a selected local discovery agent, Ritual hands it session/history paths and the agent presents a Markdown table in its own window.
- Given agent discovery findings, the agent adds an opinionated suggestion and asks which skill or skills to implement.
- Given declined, unavailable, or failed agent discovery, Ritual clusters repeated prompts locally and presents fallback candidates.
- Given no strong candidate, Ritual shows near-misses and does not generate by default.
- Given an approved candidate, Ritual can invoke `claude` or `codex` locally to create a high-quality draft skill using the embedded skill-generation prompt.
- Given a draft skill, Ritual blocks writes on structural validation failures.
- Given a valid approved draft, Ritual writes the same `SKILL.md` to Claude, Codex/agents, or both selected targets.
- Given a run inside a repository, Ritual recommends project-local scope and both ecosystems by default.

## Open Questions

- Which Claude and Codex history file formats should be supported first?
- What exact lexical similarity algorithm should be used for local-only clustering?
- What should the built-in skill-generation prompt versioning scheme look like?
- What are the exact global Claude and global Codex/agents skill directories on each supported operating system?
- Should generated skills include provenance comments linking back to source prompt examples, or would that leak too much history into reusable artifacts?
- What length threshold should trigger a warning for an overly long `SKILL.md`?

## Implementation Assumptions

- Claude and Codex history are available as local files on the user's machine.
- At least one local drafting executable, `claude` or `codex`, may be installed.
- `agnix` may not be installed, so built-in validation is required for the MVP.
- User approval is required before any generated skill is written.
- The current working directory is the project-local root for project-specific output.
