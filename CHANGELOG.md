## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial product requirements for Ritual as an interactive CLI that turns repeated Claude and Codex prompts into reusable skills.
- Technical specification for the TypeScript, Biome, typecheck, Bun package-manager workflow, npm registry distribution, and tag-driven GitHub Actions release architecture.
- Production TypeScript CLI scaffold with strict ESM build output and Bun-managed `ritual` executable.
- Local Claude and Codex JSON/JSONL history discovery, resilient user-prompt extraction, and source diagnostics.
- Local prompt normalization, lexical clustering, recurrence ranking, candidate selection, and two-match fallback handling.
- Project/global scope selection, Claude and Codex/agents target resolution, safe skill-name sanitization, and overwrite protection.
- Explicitly approved `claude` or `codex` drafting with an embedded versioned skill-generation prompt.
- Direct skill writes to selected target paths with built-in `SKILL.md` validation and optional `agnix`.
- Unit and integration tests covering parsers, ranking, path safety, validation, and the full fixture-driven session flow.
- GitHub Actions CI and tag-driven Bun release workflow.

### Changed

- Launch Claude or Codex as an inherited terminal session for skill drafting, passing the generated skill prompt as the final argv argument and validating the draft file the agent writes.
- Simplified the skill generation flow by removing the draft workspace, global-write confirmation, launch confirmation, final-write confirmation, editor prompt, validation warning prompt, and draft cleanup prompt.
- Refactored the Ritual CLI entrypoint into a reusable runtime lifecycle wrapper with signal handling, stdin cleanup, help normalization, and top-level error funneling while preserving the one-command/no-flags MVP contract.
- Switched the project package manager from npm to Bun, replacing `package-lock.json` with `bun.lock` and updating local, CI, and release commands to use `bun`.
- Made the interactive candidate-review flow friendlier by replacing raw internal slugs, lexical-coherence details, and near-miss terminology with plain workflow summaries and actions.
- Move directly from choosing a repeated workflow into local-agent draft setup instead of showing a second approval menu.
- Detect available local draft generators and ask the user to choose Claude Code or Codex before creating the `SKILL.md` draft, instead of silently preferring the first executable found.
- Summarize scanned history sources and repeated diagnostics so users see concise totals instead of a long line-by-line dump for every skipped session file.
- Cleanly handle terminal prompt cancellation and release stdin after the interactive CLI settles.

### Fixed

- Removed stale draft wording from the direct skill generation flow and made successful progress spinners clear without printing `ok ...` status lines.
- Avoid Node's unsettled top-level-await warning during interactive prompts by deferring stdin unref cleanup until the CLI session settles.
- Parse real Codex session `response_item.payload` records so user-authored prompts are extracted from `~/.codex/sessions`.
- Ignore injected Codex context blocks such as environment metadata, app/plugin instructions, skill instructions, and `AGENTS.md` context when extracting user prompts.
- Avoid generating suggested skill names from attachment/path noise such as image filenames and local filesystem fragments.
